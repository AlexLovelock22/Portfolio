            Cove Pavilion Pre-school is a Community Pre-school housed in a Pavilion building on Cove Green in
            Farnborough, and has been established since 1966.<br><br>
            The pre-school is open during the hours of 8.00 a.m. and 3.45 p.m. Monday to Friday, during term times. Your
            child may attend in a combination of ways during these times. There is a maximum attendance of 30 children
            at any one time. The setting offers as much flexibility of attendance as possible to assist parents around
            their work commitments. Times can only be available in accordance with vacancies within the setting.<br><br>
            The pre-school is run by a Management Committee and highly trained staff led by an experienced Early Years
            Teacher. All members of staff hold First Aid certificates.
